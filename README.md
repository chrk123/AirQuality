# AirQuality

An arduino project that aims to construct an air quality monitoring system based on three different hardware sensors.

## Sensirion SCD41

This one provides readings for CO2, temperature and humidity.

## Sensirion SPS30

This one provides readings for PM1.0, PM2.5, PM4 and PM10. Not implemented yet.

## Sensirion SGP30

This one is used to measure VOC. Not implemented yet.

## Future ideas

In the future, this project will either connect a display (LCD or OLED) for visualization purposes, or provide the data via bluetooth, in which case an app will be used for visualization.
